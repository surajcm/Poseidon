* **Implement Containerization with Docker:** Add Docker support to containerize the application, enabling easier deployment, scaling, and environment consistency across development and production.
* **Enhance Security Features:** Integrate authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth) and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data like customer invoices and inventory, reducing vulnerability risks.
* **Add Comprehensive Testing Suite:** Expand beyond unit tests to include integration, end-to-end, and performance tests using frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, or Selenium, aiming for higher code coverage (currently monitored via SonarCloud).
* **Introduce API Versioning and Documentation:** Implement versioning for REST APIs (e.g., via URL paths) and auto-generate API docs with tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to improve maintainability and developer experience.
* **Optimize Performance and Monitoring:** Add caching (e.g., Redis), database query optimizations, and integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus or ELK stack for real-time insights into application health and performance.
